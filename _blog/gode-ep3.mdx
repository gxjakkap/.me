Some thoughts gone throught me about going mainstream way, So I switch my API from Python Flask to ExpressJS and rewrite it in TypeScript.

⠀

In the making of that I thought, Why didn't I make a library for this? And I made one! It's called [gode.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gode.js). Now my API also rely on this library. I don't know if this is a good thing or not, I just feels like It'd be easier for me.

⠀

![gode.js](https://res.cloudinary.com/dynrld3nm/image/upload/c_scale,h_263,q_35/v1657805664/guntxjakka.me/projects/gode.js_ljogrk.webp)

⠀

For API v2, There's a new endpoints added.

- `GET v2/convert/:EngLayout/:ThaLayout?message=""`

- `POST v2/raw`

⠀

Which both of that essentially do the same thing. Just with a different HTTP method.

⠀

⠀

I also changed the base url from `api.guntxjakka.me` to `api.gode.app` .

⠀

For the website, I'm in the process of rewriting it in NuxtJS. (I don't even know why. I just feels like I want to.) I also added a layout dropdown menu (Which was a feature that was originally planned when I started working on the website.).

Still a long way on this project. And I must say that This project might not be that complex, but I'm proud of it.
