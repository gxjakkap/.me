The legend passed today.

Technoblade. One of the best YouTubers, Gamers and Streamers ever. [Passed away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPMluEVUqS0) from stage 4 cancer. Specifically sarcoma. 10 months ago he posted a video called ["where I've been"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9_aYyEDMD0) announcing his diagnosis of cancer. 10 months later he's already gone. I'm still in shock. Words cannot express how I felt about this news.

I watched his video from time to time, and he never fails to entertain me. He made me laugh and cheer me up when I'm in a bad mood. And I'm sure he also did that to millions of millions of people around the world. Dead sure that he's inspired a lot of people to make their content or start playing Minecraft PvP. If not, I'm still sure he made some positive impact on a lot of people.

Technoblade's family is also selling merchandise on [Technoblade's website](https://technoblade.com) to raise money for the [Sarcoma Foundation of America](https://www.curesarcoma.org/). If you're in the US, you could check it out (I'm not sure about oversea shipping costs so yeah).
