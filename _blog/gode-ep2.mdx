Last time, I wrote about how I created my API with flask. This time, I created a website out of it. Here's how.

⠀

Being an unexperienced, uncreative and lazy guy I am, I found some html code from [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/chris__sev/pen/zYxQKrP/). (yeah that explains a lot why my website look like google.com). After that I wrote a script, add some more modification and now I have [gode.app](https://gode.app).

The website pretty much did that simple job I wanted. (Because there's nothing complicated about it.). But being a darkmode fan, I have to add a dark/light mode button.

⠀

Using TailwindCSS, it's pretty easy to implement a darkmode button. But I'm no expert, so I'll leave a tutorial that I followed to implement it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-dark-mode-switcher-with-tailwind-css-and-flowbite/).

This pretty much sums up what I've did with gode.app website. ฆำำ ันี รื ะ้ำ ืำปะ ยนหะ+
