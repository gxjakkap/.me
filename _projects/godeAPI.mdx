Lullar’s de = กำ has been around for years and that’s what Thais use most when they forget to change their layout. The story began when I saw my girlfriend’s tweet in the wrong layout and I want to do something about that. What came to my mind immediately is Twitter bot that reply to you when got mentioned in the replies with the converted phrase. I go back to Lullar’s website to see if there’s an API that I can use and there isn’t one. That’s why I decided to make my own.
